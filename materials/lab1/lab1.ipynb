        "\n",
        "So stay tuned if you are interested in, for example, what data is collected when using platforms like ChatGPT, how to retrieve and analyze TikTok or Instagram data, and what we can learn about society from Whatsapp data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The labs will be written in Python (but don't worry, we __not__ expect you to know or learn Python) and published as .ipynb files (Jupyter notebooks) that you can easily open via Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "These files consist of multiple cells containing text or code. You can edit an existing cell by double-clicking it. You can insert text by clicking the \"+ Text\" button in the top left corner and add code by clicking the \"+ Code\" button. To add your answers, simply double-click on the cell that says \"*ADD YOUR ANSWERS HERE*\".\n",

        "You will need to submit the labs as a PDF by 17:00 the following Monday. This can be done directly from Colab (File -> Print --> PDF), or you can copy the answers into a Word document and export it as a PDF."

        "- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation: This is a simple way to keep info that both humans and computers can easily read.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Spreadsheets (e.g. Excel files, CSV or TSV). CSV or TSV are basic spreadsheets stored in a plain text file. Each line is a row, and values in each row are separated by commas (CSV) or tabs (TSV). It's simple and works well for lists of things like names or numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- PDF (Portable Document Format).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Databases: Different types of databases can keep different types of information. They have some perks, like you can retrieve and write data continiously and easily.\n",

        "- Geographical information: e.g. .geojson\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
