title: Group project guidelines
---

The group project is a central part of the course. The project is designed to give you hands-on experience with digital trace data, and to apply the knowledge you have gained in the course to a real-world problem. In the practical you will work in groups to collect text data, analyze it using Natural Language Processing models, to discuss the errors and biases that you encounter in the data, and to interpret the results in light of the errors.



## Practical information
* The project consists of two assignments, each worth 30% of the final grade. 
* The groups will be formed in the first practical. If you miss the first practical, you will not be able to participate in the group project and will fail the course.
* The progress will be tracked in four feedback sessions, a 15 minute meeting with the lectures to discuss the progress of the project. The feedback sessions are mandatory.


## Assignment 1: Errors in data collection (30% of the grade)
The first assignment is to identify and discuss the errors that you anticipate when collecting data for your research question (RQ). You will collect text data using one of the methods explained in the lectures/labs (data donation, scraping, APIs). 

The outcome is a short report (<1000 words) that you will submit in week 5 (see weekly schedule). You will receive feedback from the lecturers during the feedback sessions (weeks 3 and 4).

Steps:
- Decide on a specific RQ and a target dataset. Since you will use the data in the second assignment, make sure that the data is suitable for the analysis you have in mind. In the second assignment, you will label the data using text classification models. These allow you to analyze text data in terms of the content of the text. We recommend you to use one of the proposed themes: political polarization, hate speech, personality traits or mental health. 
- Collect the data using the methods explained in the lectures/labs: either data donation (lab 2), or scraping/APIs (lab 3)
- Attend _Feedback session I_ to discuss your progress
- Discuss the errors (representation and measurement) that you anticipate when answering the RQ with the proposed data
- Attend _Feedback session II_ to discuss your progress
- Submit a short report (<1000 words) in week 5 (see weekly schedule)


## Assignment 2: Errors in data labeling and moving past errors
In the second assignment you will analyze the data collected in the first assignment. For this you will use a Natural Language Processing model of your choice to label the data. You will discuss the errors that you encounter in the labeling process, and how you will move past these errors in data collection and data labeling.

The outcome is a final presentation (15 minutes) that you will present in week 8 (see weekly schedule).

You will receive feedback from the lecturers during the feedback sessions (weeks 7 and 8).

Steps:
- Run a text classification model of your choice from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) on the data collected in the first assignment.
- Reflect on the errors you expect during hte labeling process
- Attend _Feedback session III_ to discuss your progress
- Reflect on how you would expand the study to tackle these issues. What type of data would you need to collect?
- Attend _Feedback session IV_ to discuss your progress
- Present the group project in week 8 (see weekly schedule)
